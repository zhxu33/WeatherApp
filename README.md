# Tools used HTML, CSS, Javascript:
This project is a frontend application that allows users to search for city weather data using OpenWeatherAPI. I incorporated a side bar to store search history with options to favorite or delete cities. In the future, I plan to add a backend system to store user data and display more weather information.
